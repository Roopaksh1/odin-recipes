    <h1>Banana &amp; Vanilla Cupcakes</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="desc">Cupcakes are all the rage. Here is a simple recipe that I love to use. You can get as creative as
        you feel with
        the decoration by adding colors to the Buttercream and piping it creatively, adding sprinkles, or topping them
        with coconut, these are great fun to make!</p>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol class="directions">
        <li>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
                <p>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper muffin
                    liners.</p>
            </div>
        </li>

        <li>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
                <p>Whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl; set aside. Beat 1/2 cup butter and the
                    white
                    sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time,
                    allowing
                    each to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next. Beat in the vanilla with the last egg.
                    Pour in
                    the flour mixture alternately with the milk, mixing until just incorporated. Fold in the chopped
                    bananas,
                    mixing just enough to evenly combine. Pour the batter into prepared cups.</p>
            </div>
        </li>

        <li>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
                <p>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20
                    minutes.
                    Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.</p>
            </div>
        </li>

        <li>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
                <p>While the cupcakes are cooling, make the buttercream by beating 2/3 cup of butter in a bowl until
                    smooth
                    and
                    glossy. Beat in the vanilla, followed by the confectioners' sugar. Once no dry lumps of sugar
                    remain, add
                    the cream and food coloring. Whip on high speed until light and fluffy. Frost the cooled cupcakes
                    with the
                    buttercream frosting.</p>
            </div>
