            <div>
                <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
                <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and line 4 8-inch round cake pans with
                    parchment
                    paper.</p>
            </div>
        </li>

        <li>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
                <p>BCombine white cake mix, egg whites, vegetable oil, milk, and vanilla extract in a large mixing bowl.
                    Beat for 30 seconds using an electric mixer on low speed. Increase mixer speed to medium and beat
                    for 2 more
                    minutes. The batter will still be slightly lumpy..</p>
            </div>
        </li>

        <li>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
                <p>To make the red cakes, measure half the batter into a separate bowl and whisk in red food coloring.
                    Evenly transfer the red batter into 2 of the 8-inch prepared cake pans; smooth tops of batter with a
                    spatula.
                    Transfer half of the remaining uncolored batter into a 3rd prepared cake pan; smooth top as before.
                    This
                    will be the white cake portion.</p>
            </div>
        </li>

        <li>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
                <p>Add blue food coloring to the remaining uncolored batter in the large mixing bowl; fold 1 cup white
                    chocolate chips into blue batter until combined. Transfer batter to remaining prepared 8-inch cake
                    pan;
                    smooth top of batter with a spatula..</p>
            </div>
        </li>

        <li>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
                <p>Bake all 4 cakes in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of each cake comes
                    out clean, about 30 minutes. Remove the cakes from oven and place onto cooling racks until cooled
                    completely.
                </p>
            </div>

        <li>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Step 5</strong></p>
                <p>Run a knife around edge of each cooled cake. Invert cakes, remove pans, and peel off parchment paper.
                    Use a
                    sharp knife to trim tops of cakes flat and even.</p>
            </div>
        </li>

        <li>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Step 6</strong></p>
                <p>Cut both of the red cake layers and the white cake layer in half horizontally. You will have 4 thin
                    red
                    cake
                    layers and 2 thin white cake layers.</p>
            </div>
        </li>

        <li>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Step 7</strong></p>
                <p>Place a 4-inch round stencil on top of 1 thin red cake layer; cut out a 4-inch red cake round.
                    Repeat,
                    placing stencil on 1 thin white cake layer to make 1 4-inch white cake round. Center the 4-inch
                    round
                    stencil on the blue cake; cut out and remove center portion covered by the stencil to make a blue
                    cake
                    ring.</p>
            </div>

                <p>To assemble the cake, you will need 2 thin 8-inch red cake layers, 1 thin 8-inch white cake layer, 1
                    4-inch
                    thin red cake circle, 1 4-inch thin white cake circle, and 1 blue 8-inch cake ring. Reserve the
                    leftover
                    thin red cake layer and other cake pieces for making crumbs for decorating.</p>
            </div>
        </li>

        <li>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Step 9</strong></p>
                <p>To assemble cake, place 1 8-inch thin red cake layer on a cake pan and frost the top generously with
                    white
                    frosting. Place the thin 8-inch white cake layer on top of the red one, and frost the top. Place
                    remaining
                    8-inch thin red cake layer atop the white one. Frost the red layer.</p>
            </div>
        </li>

        <li>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Step 10</strong></p>
                <p>Place the blue ring cake on top of the 2nd red cake layer and carefully frost the inside of the blue
                    cake
                    ring. Gently fit the 4-inch white cake layer into the blue cake ring. Frost the top of the 4-inch
                    white
                    center. Place the 4-inch red cake layer on top of the white one. Gently press small cake circles
                    flush
                    with
                    the top of the blue ring.</p>
            </div>
        </li>

        <li>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Step 11</strong></p>
                <p>Frost the entire outside of the cake generously with the remaining frosting.</p>
            </div>
        </li>

        <li>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Step 12</strong></p>
                <p>Crumble red and blue pieces of leftover cake into 2 separate bowls. Score lines into the top of the
                    cake's
                    frosting with a kitchen knife to make a flag design on top of the cake. It should have a 2-inch
                    square
                    at
                    the upper left for blue field and white stars, and 7 thick horizontal stripes about 1 inch wide.</p>
            </div>
        </li>

        <li>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Step 13</strong></p>
                <p>Fill the square field at the upper left with blue crumbs and press 1 tablespoon white chocolate chips
                    upside-down into the blue crumbs to make 'stars.' Fill the bottom stripe and every other stripe with
                    red
                    crumbs to make red stripes. Sprinkle white sugar generously into the white stripes to make them
                    stand
                    out.</p>
            </div>
        </li>

        <li>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Step 14</strong></p>
                <p>To serve, cut cake into wedges. The inside of the cake will reveal its layers of red and white
                    stripes
                    and
                    blue field with white chocolate chip stars in every slice..</p>
            </div>
